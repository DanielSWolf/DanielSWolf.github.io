Hi! I'm Daniel Wolf, a software developer in Munch, Germany. I'm the author of https://github.com/DanielSWolf/rhubarb-lip-sync[Rhubarb Lip Sync].

I like old adventure games and processing sound. On this blog, I'll record some of my insights. Maybe they can be helpful -- if not to others, then at least to myself in a few years' time!
